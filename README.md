# Primitive Google - Google Search Clone

##  The Idea of the Project
Primitive Google is a minimalistic clone of the Google Search engine interface. It replicates core search functionalities, including basic web search, image search, and an advanced search page that allows users to narrow down queries using multiple filters. The project focuses on frontend design precision and integration with external search parameters, simulating the behavior of a real search engine.

## The Features
- Basic web search page with a clean Google-like layout
- Image search page styled to match Google Images
- Advanced search form:
  - Fields for exact phrases, excluded words, number ranges, and more
  - Proper URL parameter formatting for real search behavior
- Precise HTML and CSS styling to mimic Googleâ€™s interface
- Responsive design compatible with desktop and mobile
